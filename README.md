This project is a Speech-to-Text Medical Transcription Server built using Python. It transcribes medical audio recordings, performs text generation, corrects spelling mistakes, and saves the transcribed text into a database.

Features:
Speech-to-Text Transcription: Utilizes a pre-trained model to transcribe medical audio recordings into text format.

Text Generation: Generates additional medical text based on the transcribed audio using a pre-trained model.

Spelling Correction: Corrects spelling mistakes in the generated text.

Database Integration: Stores the transcribed text in a MySQL database.

User Authentication: Provides user authentication for accessing the transcription server.
